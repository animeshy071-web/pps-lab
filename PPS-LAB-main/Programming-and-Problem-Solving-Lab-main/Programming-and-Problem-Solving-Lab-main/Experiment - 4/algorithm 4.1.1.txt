Algorithm: Union, Intersection and Difference of Two Sets

Step 1: Start

Step 2: Input elements of Set A as space-separated integers

Step 3: Convert the input into a set and store it in A

Step 4: Input elements of Set B as space-separated integers

Step 5: Convert the input into a set and store it in B

Step 6: Find the union of sets
  union_set = A ∪ B

Step 7: Find the intersection of sets
  intersection_set = A ∩ B

Step 8: Find the difference of sets
  difference_set = A − B

Step 9: Print "Union:" followed by union_set

Step 10: Print "Intersection:" followed by intersection_set

Step 11: Print "Difference:" followed by difference_set

Step 12: Stop
